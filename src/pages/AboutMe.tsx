        I am a software developer with experience in building web applications.
        My passion is to create beautiful, responsive, user friendly websites.
        I'm always eager to learn new things. I have developed skills in
        programming languages such as C#, JavaScript and Typescript. In addition
        to my technical knowledge, I also possess good communication skills that
        enable me to work well within teams. Aside from being an avid learner, I
        enjoy spending time outdoors exploring the natural world around me.
